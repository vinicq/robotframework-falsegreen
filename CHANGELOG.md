## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added

- Initial release. Deterministic static scanner for false-positive Robot Framework
  tests, built on the official `robot.api.get_model` parser (no execution).
- Detection codes: C2 (empty test), C2b (no verification keyword), C3 (swallowed
  `Run Keyword And Ignore Error`/`Return Status`), C5 (always-true), C7 (self-compare),
  C16 (`Sleep` as synchronization), C21 (conditional-only verification), C32 (skipped). Codes share ids with the sibling
  scanners where the concept matches.
- Verification-keyword recognition across libraries: the `Should` convention plus
  SeleniumLibrary/AppiumLibrary, Browser's assertion engine (`Get ... == expected`),
  RESTinstance schema keywords, DatabaseLibrary, RequestsLibrary, and custom
  `Verify*`/`Assert*`/`Validate*`/`Check *` keywords.
- CLI: paths, `--json`, `--disable`, `--version`. Exit codes 0/10/20.
